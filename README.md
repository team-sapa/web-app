# UF Study Abroad Peer Advisors

The Study Abroad Peer Advisor (SAPA) organization is a group of students who have previously studied abroad and are now dedicated to sharing their experiences with other students. We assist students interested in learning more about UFâ€™s study abroad opportunities by matching them with students who have studied on similar programs/locations, or who share similar academic interests.
